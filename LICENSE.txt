HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
=======================

JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the 
primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.
In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 is developed by a group
of volunteers.
