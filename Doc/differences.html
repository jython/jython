<h3>Differences between CPython and JPython</h3>

<P>CPython and JPython are two different implementations of the Python
language. While a <A HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/ref">Language
Reference</A> exists for the Python language, there are a number of
features of the language that are incompletely specified.  The
following lists all known differences between the two implementations
of the Python language.  These differences range from the trivial --
JPython prints &quot;1.0E20&quot; where CPython prints
&quot;1e+020&quot; -- to the dramatic -- everything in JPython is an
instance of a class.  At some point more effort should be made to
separate the interesting differences from the mundane.

<p>Any other differences not listed here can probably be considered a
bug in JPython.  Understand of course that CPython and JPython advance 
at different paces.  All efforts are made to keep the two
implementations in sync, but that's not always possible.

<p><i>This list
has been updated to describe the differences between JPython 1.1 and
CPython 1.5.2</i>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<UL>
    <LI>JPython has a different interpretation of floating point
    literals. CPython doesn't allow 001.1 <I>CPython should be
    fixed.</I>

    <p><LI>JPython supports continue in a try clause. <I>CPython
    should be fixed - but don't hold your breath.</I>
</UL>

<h3>Standard types, functions and behavior</h3>

<UL>
	<LI>JPython string objects support full two-byte Unicode
	characters and the functions in the string module are
	Unicode-aware. <I>CPython should add Unicode support in the
	future, though the details of this are still unclear.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython formats floating point numbers differently,
	e.g. an upper case 'E' is used, and it switches over to E
	notation sooner than CPython does. <I>Both behaviors are
	acceptable.</I>

	<p><LI>In JPython, 0.1**4 is printed as
	1.0000000000000002E-4. In CPython, it is printed 0.0001, even
	though it is not actually equal to 0.0001. <I>Both behaviors
	are acceptable for now -- this is still being discussed.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython sequences support three argument
	slices. i.e. range(3)[::-1] == [2,1,0]. <I>CPython should be
	fixed.</I>

	<p><LI>Every object in JPython is an instance of a class --
	there are no types in JPython. i.e. [].__class__ is a sensible
	thing to write in JPython. <I>CPython should be fixed - but
	don't hold your breath.</I>

	<p><LI>The .tell() method on JPython file objects returns a
	Python long, while the .tell() method on CPython file objects
	returns a Python int.  <I>Whether or not both behaviors are
	acceptable is still unclear.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython file objects are still missing some
	functionality -- see todo list in PyFile.java. (Hopefully in
	the near future this can be changed to read -- JPython file
	objects include the following extra functionality to properly
	handle non-ascii files...) <I>JPython should be fixed.</I>

	<p><LI>In CPython, range(0.1, 3.2) yields the surprising [0,
	1, 2]. JPython does the right thing (reject float arguments).
	-- Many other functions taking int arguments have the same
	   problem. <I>CPython should be fixed.</I>

	<p><LI>In CPython, the list.append() method takes multiple
	arguments and forms a tuple. JPython's append() method
	requires one argument only. <I>CPython should be fixed -- but
	probably won't be due to backwards compatibility.</I>

	<p><LI>The __name__ attribute of built-in extension modules
	(e.g. 'sys') is different. <I>Both behaviors are
	acceptable.</I>

	<p><LI>In many cases, introspection yields different results;
	e.g. dir([]) yields an empty list in JPython but a list of
	list methods in CPython. Arguably, JPython is right, although
	I find CPython's behavior more convenient. <I>Both behaviors
	are acceptable.</I>

	<p><LI>In JPython, dir() doesn't return __name__ even if it is
	supported. <I>JPython should be fixed</I>

	<p><LI>JPython defines __debug__, but always sets it equal to
	1.  <I>JPython should implement CPython's -O option.</I>

	<p><LI>The locals() dictionary in JPython is mutable from
	within a function. After &quot;def foo(x=1): locals()['x'] =
	2; print x&quot; foo() prints 1 in CPython and 2 in
	JPython. Jim thinks that JPython's behavior is better here
	-- but the best answer might be that locals() should be
	   considered a read-only dictionary.<I> Proper behavior here
	   is still unclear.</I> 

	<p><LI>JPython doesn't support restricted execution mode and
	doesn't have the magic __builtins__ in every namespace.
	<I>JPython will probably never support restricted execution
	mode -- Java's security model is recommended instead.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython uses different values for the IOError
	argument. This causes trouble for people who unpack the value
	into an (errno, message) tuple. <I>Both behaviors are
	acceptable.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython function objects don't have the
	func_name attribute (an alias for __name__). <I>This attribute
	is considered obsolete and won't be supported by JPython.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython code objects are missing other attributes --
	co_code, co_consts, co_flags, co_lnotab, co_names, co_nlocals,
	co_stacksize. <I>These attributes will probably never be
	supported in JPython due to its implementation of code objects
	as compiled Java bytecodes.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython has &quot;true&quot; garbage collection whereas
	CPython uses reference counting. This means that in JPython
	users don't need to worry about handling circular references
	as these are guaranteed to be collected properly.&nbsp; On the
	other hand, users of JPython have no guarantees of when an
	object will be finalized -- this can cause problems for people
	who use open(&quot;foo&quot;, 'r').read() excessively. <I>Both
	behaviors are acceptable -- and highly unlikely to change.</I>

	<p><LI>In JPython, __del__() methods in user-defined classes
	are never called. <i>Some future version of JPython might
	provide limited support for __del__(), but see the above
	item.</i>

	<p><LI>The dictionaries used by classes, instances, and
	modules in JPython are not the same as the dictionaries
	created by {}. They are StringMap's which require all of their
	keys to be strings. After &quot;class c: pass&quot;,
	c.__dict__[1] = 2 will work in CPython, but will raise a
	&quot;TypeError: keys in namespace must be strings&quot; error
	in JPython.  <I>Both behaviors are acceptable -- CPython might
	adopt JPython's approach in the future for the performance
	gains it can provide.</I>
</UL>

<h3>Extension modules</h3>

<UL>
	<LI>JPython supports all java packages as extension
	modules. i.e. from &quot;java.lang import System&quot; will
	work in any JPython implementation. <I>This functionality
	might be added as an optional extension to some future version
	of CPython.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython includes the builtin module jarray -- which
	allows Python programmers to create and manipulate Java array
	objects.

	<p><LI>Lots of builtin extension modules don't exist in JPython.
	<UL>
	    <LI>Modules struct, cPickle, cStringIO, and operator were
	    all added for JPython v1.1.  The following are likely to
	    be implemented in a future version of JPython -- cmath.
	    
	    <p><LI>The following are under consideration (working code
	    would make the decision much easier ;-) -- array, select,
	    a dbm/gdbm/bsddb style module, Numeric. 

	    <p><LI>The following are highly unlikely any time soon --
	    Tkinter.
	    
	    <p><LI>Let me know if something should be added to this
	    list.
	</UL>

	<p><LI>__builtin__ module
	<UL>
	    <p><LI>Incomplete implementation of __import__ -- only one
	    argument is allowed and replacing this with a user-defined 
	    function has no effect. <I>JPython might be fixed in a
	    future release, but CPython will probably adopt a new
	    import mechanism in the near future, so JPython may not
	    change until the new mechanism is defined.</I>
	</UL>

	<p><LI>os module
	<UL>
		<LI>popen() and system() are missing. <I>JPython should be
		fixed, patches would be graciously accepted.</I>

		<p><LI>os.path.normcase() exists but may not be correctly
		implemented. This one is extremely
		frustrating as there seems no portable way to
		implement in Java.

		<p><LI>chmod(), chown(), getpid(), fork(), ... are
		missing, stat exists but is implemented
		incompletely. These functions are all very Unix
		specific and it is unlikely they will ever be properly
		supported in a 100% Pure Java implementation.

		<p>Finn Bock has created
		a JNI/C++ implementation for the posix module.  See
		<a href="http://pip.dknet.dk/~pip1848/jpython/modules.html">
		Finn Bock's JPython modules page</a> for details.
		Note that his cPickle, cStringIO, binascii, and struct 
		modules have all been integrated into JPython 1.1.
	</UL>

	<p><LI>The socket module is limited.

	<p><LI>sys module

	<UL>
	    <p><LI>JPython is still missing exitfunc

	    <p><LI>Also missing executable, getrefcount,
	    setcheckinterval which don't make much sense for JPython.
	    
	</UL>

	<p><LI>thread module
	<UL>
	    <p><LI>CPython's thread modules defines some aliases that
	    JPython's doesn't. <I>These aliases are considered
	    obsolete and won't be supported by JPython.</I>
	</UL>
</UL>

<h3>Interpreter and environment</h3>

<UL>
	<p><LI>JPython doesn't catch interrupts. <I>Only fixable with
	a GUI console since interrupts are not supported by Java.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython doesn't have command line editing. <I>Only
	fixable with a GUI console.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython should have a feature similar to
	$PYTHONSTARTUP, which specifies a script to run at the start
	of interactive mode only.
	
	<p><LI>JPython supports
	<a href="interpreter.html">different command line options</a> than
	CPython, e.g. &quot;-jar&quot; and &quot;-D&quot;.  It
	also has a different convention for indicating non-interactive
	standard input (the Java runtime needs help).
