<h3>Differences between CPython and JPython</h3>

<P>CPython and JPython are two different implementations of the Python
language. While a <A HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/ref">Language
Reference</A> exists for the Python language, there are a number of
features of the language that are incompletely specified.  The
following lists all known differences between the two implementations
of the Python language.  These differences range from the trivial --
JPython prints &quot;1.0E20&quot; where CPython prints
&quot;1e+020&quot; -- to the dramatic -- everything in JPython is an
instance of a class.  At some point more effort should be made to
separate the interesting differences from the mundane. These
differences are based on JPython-1.0.0 and CPython-1.5.1.</P>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<UL>
    <LI>JPython has a different interpretation of floating point
    literals. CPython doesn't allow 001.1, and does allow 0e and even
    0e-. <I>CPython should be fixed.</I> 

    <p><LI>JPython supports continue in a try clause. <I>CPython
    should be fixed - but don't hold your breath.</I>

    <p><LI>JPython doesn't support raise without arguments. <I>JPython
    should be fixed in v1.1</I>
</UL>

<h3>Standard types, functions and behavior</h3>

<UL>
	<LI>JPython string objects support full two-byte Unicode
	characters and the functions in the string module are
	Unicode-aware. <I>CPython should add Unicode support in the
	future, though the details of this are still unclear.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython formats floating point numbers differently,
	e.g. an upper case 'E' is used, and it switches over to E
	notation sooner than CPython does. <I>Both behaviors are
	acceptable.</I>

	<p><LI>In JPython, 0.1**4 is printed as
	1.0000000000000002E-4. In CPython, it is printed 0.0001, even
	though it is not actually equal to 0.0001. <I>Both behaviors
	are acceptable for now -- this is still being discussed.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython supports looping over a dictionary. <I>JPython
	should be fixed in v1.1</I>

	<p><LI>JPython sequences support three argument
	slices. i.e. range(3)[::-1] == [2,1,0]. <I>CPython should be
	fixed.</I>

	<p><LI>Every object in JPython is an instance of a class --
	there are no types in JPython. i.e. [].__class__ is a sensible
	thing to write in JPython. <I>CPython should be fixed - but
	don't hold your breath.</I>

	<p><LI>The .tell() method on JPython file objects returns a
	Python long, while the .tell() method on CPython file objects
	returns a Python int.  <I>Whether or not both behaviors are
	acceptable is still unclear.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython file objects are still missing some
	functionality -- see todo list in PyFile.java. (Hopefully in
	the near future this can be changed to read -- JPython file
	objects include the following extra functionality to properly
	handle non-ascii files...) <I>JPython should be fixed in
	v1.1</I>

	<p><LI>In JPython, standard exceptions are still
	strings. <I>JPython should be fixed in v1.1</I>

	<p><LI>In CPython, range(0.1, 3.2) yields the surprising [0,
	1, 2]. JPython does the right thing (reject float arguments).
	-- Many other functions taking int arguments have the same
	   problem. <I>CPython should be fixed.</I>

	<p><LI>In CPython, the list.append() method takes multiple
	arguments and forms a tuple. JPython's append() method
	requires one argument only. <I>CPython should be fixed -- but
	probably won't be due to backwards compatibility.</I>.

	<p><LI>In JPython, printing a recursive list or dictionary
	causes a stack overflow. CPython now uses ellipses to indicate
	recursive items, e.g. ``l = []; l.append(l); print l'' prints
	``[[...]]''. <I>JPython should be fixed in v1.1</I>

	<p><LI>In JPython, when an AttributeError is raised, it
	attempts to call repr() on the object in order to produce a
	nic error message. This can cause the exception to change into
	java.lang.StackOverflowError because of the previous
	item. (CPython only puts the *type* in the message here, which
	is safer.) <I>Proper behavior here is still unclear.</I>

	<p><LI>The __name__ attribute of built-in extension modules
	(e.g. 'sys') is different. <I>Both behaviors are
	acceptable.</I>

	<p><LI>In many cases, introspection yields different results;
	e.g. dir([]) yields an empty list in JPython but a list of
	list methods in CPython. Arguably, JPython is right, although
	I find CPython's behavior more convenient. <I>Both behaviors
	are acceptable.</I>

	<p><LI>In JPython, dir() doesn't return __name__ even if it is
	supported. <I>JPython should be fixed in v1.1</I>

	<p><LI>JPython doesn't define __debug__. <I>JPython should be
	fixed. v1.0.1 should define __debug__ = 1 always. v1.1 should
	implement CPython's -O option.</I>

	<p><LI>The locals() dictionary in JPython is mutable from
	within a function. After &quot;def foo(x=1): locals()['x'] =
	2; print x&quot; foo() prints 1 in CPython and 2 in
	JPython. Jim thinks that JPython's behavior is better here
	-- but the best answer might be that locals() should be
	   considered a read-only dictionary.<I> Proper behavior here
	   is still unclear.</I> 

	<p><LI>JPython doesn't support restricted execution mode and
	doesn't have the magic __builtins__ in every namespace.
	<I>JPython will probably never support restricted execution
	mode -- Java's security model is recommended instead.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython uses different values for the IOError
	argument. This causes trouble for people who unpack the value
	into an (errno, message) tuple. <I>Both behaviors are
	acceptable.</I> <LI>JPython function objects don't have the
	func_name attribute (an alias for __name__). <I>This attribute
	is considered obsolete and won't be supported by JPython.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython code objects don't have the co_firstlineno
	attributes. <I>JPython should be fixed in v1.1</I>

	<p><LI>JPython code objects are missing other attributes --
	co_code, co_consts, co_flags, co_lnotab, co_names, co_nlocals,
	co_stacksize. <I>These attributes will probably never be
	supported in JPython due to its implementation of code objects
	as compiled Java bytecodes.</I>

	<p><LI>raise SystemExit, &lt;Arbitrary Object&gt; doesn't set
	the exit code to 1 when the object is not an integer or
	None. <I>JPython should be fixed in v1.0.1</I>

	<p><LI>JPython has &quot;true&quot; garbage collection whereas
	CPython uses reference counting. This means that in JPython
	users don't need to worry about handling circular references
	as these are guaranteed to be collected properly.&nbsp; On the
	other hand, users of JPython have no guarantees of when an
	object will be finalized -- this can cause problems for people
	who use open(&quot;foo&quot;, 'r').read() excessively. <I>Both
	behaviors are acceptable -- and highly unlikely to change.</I>

	<p><LI>The dictionaries used by classes, instances, and
	modules in JPython are not the same as the dictionaries
	created by {}. They are StringMap's which require all of their
	keys to be strings. After &quot;class c: pass&quot;,
	c.__dict__[1] = 2 will work in CPython, but will raise a
	&quot;TypeError: keys in namespace must be strings&quot; error
	in JPython.  <I>Both behaviors are acceptable -- CPython might
	adopt JPython's approach in the future for the performance
	gains it can provide.</I>
</UL>

<h3>Extension modules</h3>

<UL>
	<LI>JPython supports all java packages as extension
	modules. i.e. from &quot;java.lang import System&quot; will
	work in any JPython implementation. <I>This functionality
	might be added as an optional extension to some future version
	of CPython.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython includes the builtin module jarray -- which
	allows Python programmers to create and manipulate Java array
	objects.

	<p><LI>Lots of builtin extension modules don't exist in JPython.
	<UL>
	    <LI>The following are likely to be implemented in JPython
	    v1.1 -- cmath, struct, CPickle, CStringIO, and operator.
	    
	    <p><LI>The following are under consideration (working code
	    would make the decision much easier ;-) -- array, select,
	    a dbm/gdbm/bsddb style module, Numeric. 

	    <p><LI>The following are highly unlikely any time soon --
	    Tkinter.
	    
	    <p><LI>Let me know if something should be added to this list.
	</UL>

	<p><LI>__builtin__ module
	<UL>
	    <LI>Missing the input function. <I>JPython should be fixed
	    in v1.0.1</I>

	    <p><LI>Incomplete implementation of __import__ -- only one
	    argument is allowed and replacing this with a user-defined 
	    function has no effect. <I>JPython might be fixed in a
	    future release.</I>
	</UL>

	<p><LI>os module
	<UL>
		<LI>popen and system are missing. <I>JPython should be
		fixed, patcheds would be graciously accepted.</I>

		<p><LI>path.normcase. This one is extremely
		frustrating as there seems no portable way to
		implement in Java.

		<p><LI>chmod, chown, getpid, fork, stat, ... are
		missing. These functions are all very Unix specific
		and it is unlikely they will ever be properly
		supported in a 100% Pure Java implementation. Perhaps
		somebody should create a JNI/C package for Java called
		posix which provides this functionality.
	</UL>

	<p><LI>The socket module is limited.

	<p><LI>sys module

	<UL>
	    <LI>In JPython, the exception state
	    (sys.exc_{type,value,traceback} and also what
	    sys.exc_info() returns) isn't saved and restored across
	    function calls. <I>JPython should be fixed in v1.1</I>
		
	    <p><LI>JPython ignores assignment to sys.stdin. In
	    CPython, this affects raw_input() and input() but not the
	    interactive interpreter. <I>JPython should be fixed in
	    v1.1</I>

	    <p><LI>sys.exit(&lt;Arbitrary Object&gt;) doesn't work in
	    JPython. In CPython, this prints the str() of the object
	    and exits with status code 1, except if the object is
	    None, which is equivalent to sys.exit() or sys.exit(0). In
	    JPython, this complains about the object's
	    type. <I>JPython should be fixed in v1.0.1</I>
		
	    <p><LI>JPython missing attributes __stderr__, __stdin__,
	    __stdout__, builtin_module_names, exc_type, exec_prefix,
	    exitfunc, setprofile, settrace. <I>JPython should be fixed
	    in v1.1</I>

	    <p><LI>Also missing executable, getrefcount,
	    setcheckinterval which don't make much sense for JPython.
	    
	    <p><LI>JPython adds the function add_package to deal with
	    Java packages. CPython will probably never have this
	    function.
	</UL>

	<p><LI>thread module
	<UL>
	    <LI>CPython's thread module defines LockType. <I>JPython
	    should be fixed in v1.0.1</I>

	    <p><LI>CPython's thread modules defines some aliases that
	    JPython's doesn't. <I>These aliases are considered
	    obsolete and won't be supported by JPython.</I>
	</UL>
</UL>

<h3>Interpreter and environment</h3>

<UL>
	<p><LI>JPython doesn't catch interrupts. <I>Only fixable with
	a GUI console - probably standard in v1.1.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython doesn't have command line editing. <I>Only
	fixable with a GUI console - probably standard in v1.1.</I>

	<p><LI>JPython doesn't import &quot;site&quot; on
	startup. This is a standard module that tries to import
	sitecustomize which a site could use to customize
	things. Should also have a feature similar to $PYTHONSTARTUP,
	which specifies a script to run at the start of *interactive*
	mode only. <I>JPython should be fixed in v1.1</I>
	
	<p><LI>JPython supports fewer command line options than
	CPython, e.g. it doesn't support &quot;-c command&quot;. It
	also has a different convention for indicating non-interactive
	standard input (the Java runtime needs help). <I>It is still
	unclear what set of command line options will be supported in
	JPython-1.1.</I>
