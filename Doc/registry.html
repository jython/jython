The JPython Registry</H2></CENTER>
Because there is no good system independent equivalent of the Windows Registry
(or Unix envrionment variables) Java has it's own environment variable
namespace.&nbsp; JPython aquires it's namespace from the following three
sources (later sources override defaults found in earlier places).
<UL>
<LI>
The Java system properties: typically passed in on the command line</LI>

<LI>
The file pointed to by the Java system property "install.root"/registry</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
If there is no "install.root" property, JPython tries to set it by looking
for jpython in the classpath</LI>

<LI>
Whatever value for install.root is found, sys.prefix is set to this, and
sys.path has "install.root"/Lib appended</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
The file contained in "user.home"+".jpython"</LI>
</UL>
Currently there are three important variables contained in this namespace:
<UL>
<LI>
python.path</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Equivalent to the current PYTHONPATH environment variable</LI>

<LI>
Future versions will allow this to be hierarchical as is done for java.packages</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
java.packages</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Contains a list of all java packages installed on your system that JPython
wants easy access to</LI>

<LI>
This can be used hierarchically, see the default "registry" file for an
example</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
python.proxy.savedir</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
This variable should typically be left undefined.&nbsp; It is used for
caching proxy class definitions.</LI>
