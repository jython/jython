# Use this registry entry to control the list of builtin modules; you
# can add, remove, or override builtin modules.  The value for this
# registry key is a comma separated list of module entries, each entry 
# of which has the following allowable forms:
#
# name
#     The module name is `name' and the class name is
#     org.python.modules.name
#
# name:class
#     The module name is `name' and the class name is `class' where
#     class must be a fully qualified Java class name
#
# name:null
#     The module `name' is removed from the list of builtin modules
#
# A good example would be to use a jni version of os for more
# functionality by having an entry such as os:com.foo.jni.os
#python.modules.builtin = whatever
