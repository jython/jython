# You will need to get Sun's JavaCC (Java Compiler Compiler) to build
# the JPython parser.  JavaCC can be downloaded from
# http://www.sun.com/suntest/products/JavaCC/index.html
# I currently use JavaCC 0.7.1 to build JPython, our grammar files are
# incompatible with any newer version of JavaCC.  While this will be
# fixed in some future version, for now don't rebuild the .java files
# in org/python/parser.

# Uncomment these 3 lines to use the Jikes compiler.  Jikes is a Java
# compiler available from IBM's alphaWorks.  It is much faster than
# Sun's javac.  You'll need at least Jikes 0.50.  I've tested up to
# Jikes 1.02, which seems to work well.  You may need to change
# BOOTSTRAPCLASSES to point to your standard Java classes.  Jikes
# requires you to supply your own standard classes; the one described
# below comes from Sun's production JDK 1.2 for Solaris.
#
# Get Jikes from http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/formula/Jikes

# JPython uses the OROMatcher regular expression library from ORO,
# Inc. to provide its Perl5 compatible regular expression support.  We
# cannot distribute OROMatcher as source or separate class files, so
# you will have to either download OROMatcher yourself, or disable
# regular expressions in JPython.

# OROMatcher is available from www.oroinc.com.  If you download it
# yourself, change the definition of OROMATCHERROOT to point to the
# directory where you installed it.
#
# If you do not have the OROMatcher regular expression library,
# read the comments in the file org/python/modules/Makefile.
