Files in this folder support use of codespell [1], a utility that looks
for common misspellings in files. You can use it in the development
environment (pip install codespell to a venv) or from the CI. Typical
usage is:

    codespell --count --ignore-words-list="sur,statics" \
        NEWS README.md README.txt LICENSE

The --ignore-words-list option *removes* matching entries from the
dictionary of misspellings codespell attempts to correct.

When let loose on the code base, codespell finds a lot of the mistakes
in our javadoc and comments. The false alarm rate is low, but on a
large body of code, high enough to drown out the useful reports. It is
always necessary to prepare it with a list of known exceptions for the
sub-set of the code base being inspected, e.g.:

    codespell --count --ignore-words=Misc/codespell/Lib.ignore Lib
    codespell --count --ignore-words=Misc/codespell/src.ignore src

The --ignore-words option *removes* matching entries from the
dictionary used for correction: one word per line in the file named.
The idea is to use a different one for each source set.

File here named *.ignore are intended (for now) for use interactively
 when checking a specified subset of source.

words.ignore    : words in our text files
Lib.ignore      : identifiers etc. in our Python Lib
src.ignore      : identifiers etc. in our main Java source
