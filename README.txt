Welcome to Jython 2.2.1rc1
=======================
This is the first release candidate for the 2.2.1 release of Jython, an
implementation of the Python programming language on the Java Virtual Machine.
2.2.1 is a bugfix release that takes care of all of the major bugs that have
been reported since 2.2.  See the NEWS file for a more complete list of
changes.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 but it should run on an JVM
with version 1.4.2 or later.

Bug reports can be created at http://jython.org/bugs whereas more general
questions can be sent to the Jython-users mailing list, 
jython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
