Jython: Python for the Java Platform
------------------------------------

Welcome to Jython @jython.version@.
@snapshot.banner@
This is @readme.release@ release of version @jython.version.short@ of Jython.

Along with language and runtime compatibility with CPython 2.7, Jython 2.7
provides substantial support of the Python ecosystem. This includes built-in
support of pip/setuptools (you can use with bin/pip) and a native launcher
for Windows (bin/jython.exe). Python 2.7 is out of support. Running on Jython
should not be considered an alternative to porting to Python 3.

Jim Baker presented a talk at PyCon 2015 about Jython 2.7, including demos
of new features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLm3garVQFo

This release was compiled on @os.name@ using @java.vendor@ Java
version @java.version@ and requires a minimum of Java @jdk.target.version@ to run.

See LICENSE.txt for details about Jython's copyright and license, and NEWS
for detailed release notes, including bugs fixed, backward breaking changes,
and new features.

The developers extend their thanks to all who contributed to this release
of Jython, through bug reports, patches, pull requests, documentation
changes, email and conversation in any media. See ACKNOWLEDGMENTS for a
list of contributors. We are grateful to the PSF for continuing practical
help and support of the project.
