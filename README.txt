Welcome to Jython 2.2rc3
=======================

This is the third release candidate of the 2.2 version of Jython. It
contains all of the new features for the 2.2 release:
 - new-style classes
 - Java List integration
 - a PEP 302 implementation
 - iterators
 - generators
 - __future__ division
 - support for running on modern JVMs
 - a new installer
 - ssl and non-blocking support for socket

In addition to these major features, several bugs have been fixed from 2.2rc2.
See the NEWS file for a more complete list of changes.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 but it should run on
1.4.2+.

This release is intended to find any major bugs before releasing 2.2.  If none
are found, this will become the 2.2 release.  If you can run this and check for
bugs, it will be greatly appreciated.  Bug reports can be created at
http://jython.org/bugs whereas more general questions can be sent to the
Jython-users mailing list, jython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

If this release proves stable, the final release of 2.2 will be in a couple
weeks.  If not, successive release candidates will be made until all the major
bugs are ironed out.
