# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied only to releases under development.
Normally there is only one release under active development (the default branch).


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it at our [security advisory](https://github.com/jython/jython/security/advisories/new).

This project is maintained by a small team of volunteers.
As such, vulnerabilities will be handled and disclosed on a best efforts basis.
