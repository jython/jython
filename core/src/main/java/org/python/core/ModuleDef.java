/**
 * A {@code ModuleDef} is a definition from which instances of a module
 * may be made. It stands in relation to the Java classes that define
 * Python modules, somewhat in the way a Python {@code type} object
 * stands in relation to the Java classes that define Python objects.
 * <p>
 * What we most often encounter as "a module", a Python source file, is
 * actually just a definition from which a module object may be made.
 * This happens <i>once in each interpreter</i> where the module is
 * imported. A distinct object, with mutable state, represents that
 * module in each interpreter. There must therefore be a factory object
 * that has access to the definition of the module, but is able to
 * instantiate it (equivalent to executing the body of a module defined
 * in Python). A {@code ModuleDef} is that factory.
 * <p>
 * This initialisation cannot be identified with the static
 * initialisation of the Java class, since that cannot be repeated, but
 * must happen per instance. It is useful, however, to have an
 * intermediate cache of the results of processing the defining Java
 * class once statically initialised.
