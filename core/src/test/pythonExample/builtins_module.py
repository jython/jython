# The focus of this test is the way the interpreter resolves names
# in the builtins dictionary (after local and global namespaces).
# This happens in opcodes LOAD_NAME and LOAD_GLOBAL.

# Access sample objects from the builtins module implicitly
# Opcode is LOAD_NAME

int_name = int.__name__
max_name = max.__name__

# Call functions to prove we can
# Opcode is LOAD_NAME
ai = abs(-42)

# Sometimes __builtins__ is not the builtins module. Find it with:
bi = max.__self__

# Check explicit attribute access to the (real) builtins module
bi_int_name = bi.int.__name__
bi_max_name = bi.max.__name__


# Not marshallable
del bi
