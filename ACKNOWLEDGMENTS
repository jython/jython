Jython follows closely the Python language and its reference
implementation CPython, as created by Guido van Rossum.
Jython 2.7 corresponds to CPython 2.7.

Jython started as JPython, created by Jim Hugunin in 1997. JPython was
renamed to Jython by Barry Warsaw in 1999 with the 2.0 release. Since
then, Jython 2.x releases have corresponded to equivalent CPython 2.x
releases.

Jython includes, modifying as necessary, the CPython standard library,
other code objects, in certain cases ported from C to either Python
and/or Java, and other components such as documentation. These
components are licensed, like Jython itself, under the Python Software
Foundation License version 2 from the Python Software Foundation.

Samuele Pedroni contributed package manager support.

Brian Zimmer contributed zxJDBC to provide Python DB API using JDBC.

Cyrille Morvan contributed the code for the Jythonc ant task.

Alan Kennedy contributed modjy, which bridges WSGI to the Servlet API

Chris Gokey, David Syer and Finn Bock added PyServlet.
    
Yin Wang and Steve Yegge contributed the static analyzer from Google
(also called indexer).

The Jython bash startup script (fallback for bin/jython) was adapted
from the similar script written for JRuby.
