Jython follows closely the Python language and its reference
implementation CPython, as created by Guido van Rossum.
Jython 2.7 corresponds to CPython 2.7.

Jython started as JPython, created by Jim Hugunin in 1997. JPython was
renamed to Jython by Barry Warsaw in 1999 with the 2.0 release. Since
then, Jython 2.x releases have corresponded to equivalent CPython 2.x
releases.

Jython includes, modifying as necessary, the CPython standard library,
other code objects, in certain cases ported from C to either Python
and/or Java, and other components such as documentation. These
components are licensed, like Jython itself, under the Python Software
Foundation License version 2 from the Python Software Foundation.

Samuele Pedroni contributed package manager support.

Brian Zimmer contributed zxJDBC to provide Python DB API using JDBC.

Cyrille Morvan contributed the code for the Jythonc ant task.

Alan Kennedy contributed modjy, which bridges WSGI to the Servlet API

Chris Gokey, David Syer and Finn Bock added PyServlet.

Yin Wang and Steve Yegge contributed the static analyzer from Google
(also called indexer).

The Jython bash startup script (fallback for bin/jython) was adapted
from the similar script written for JRuby.

A huge thanks goes to all the members of the jpython/jython
mailing lists.  A list follows of other folks who have contributed to
JPython and Jython in ways large and small.

Since about 2012 we have been asking contributors to sign the Python
Contributor Agreement. The part following names above records evidence
of that using the codes:

A. CPython API (or checked in a CPython PR) at <date>.
B. checked in bugs.python.org at <date>.
C. self-reported at <date> (e.g. reply on GitHub).
X. last search unsuccessful at <date>.

Blank and X mean we don't know, not that the contributor hasn't signed.
