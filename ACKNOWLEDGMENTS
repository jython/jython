    Jim Hugunin invented JPython and was the primary developer while
    he was at CNRI.  In February 1999, Jim left CNRI for sunny
    California and Barry Warsaw became the primary maintainer.  Jim
    continues to provide valuable assistance, as does Python's
    inventor Guido van Rossum.

    You can contact the JPython maintainers directly via
    jpython@python.org, or the JPython community at
    jpython-interest@python.org.

    Finn Bock has been a frequent and valuable contributor to the
    JPython-interest@python.org mailing list, and has provided bug
    fixes and these important modules:

        cPickle.java
        cStringIO.java
        struct.java
        binascii.java

    A huge thanks goes to all the members of the jpython-interest
    mailing list.  Other folks who have contributed to JPython in ways
    large and small, in no particular order:

    Greg Ward
    Tony Plate
