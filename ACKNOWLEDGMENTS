    Jim Hugunin invented JPython and was the primary developer while
    he was at CNRI.  In February 1999, Jim left CNRI for sunny
    California and Barry Warsaw became the primary maintainer.  Jim
    continues to provide valuable assistance, as does Python's
    inventor Guido van Rossum.

    You can contact the JPython maintainers directly via
    jpython@python.org

    JPython-interest@python.org mailing list, and has provided bug
    fixes and these important modules:
